# MOB TRANSLATE

[https://mobtranslate.com](https://mobtranslate.com)

A fully open source community orientated endaevour to make "Google Translate" for as many Australian Aboriginal languages as possible.

I am currently converting one dictionary (Yalanji) from PDF to YAML but it is super time intensive.

Looking for any other developers who would like to help out. (writing YAML files mostly to begin with)

I've made an [issue](https://github.com/australia/mobtranslate-server/issues/1) for volunteers to get in touch with.
